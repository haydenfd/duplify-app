**Technologies/Tools** - React, Node, Express, Spotify API, TailwindCSS, Framer-Motion, NextUI React Library, prettier\
**Hosting** - AWS S3, Render Cloud Hosting (render.com)

**Note** - The backend service is running on a free instance of render.com's Cloud Hosting platform. With prolonged inactivity, the instance tends to spin down. As a result, the initial sign in with the Spotify client might take slightly longer (will still work, though). I may rent an EC2 instance to alleviate this issue, but that's a consideration for later.
